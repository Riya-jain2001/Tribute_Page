            <div class="thought">The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that
                express a lot of action in a small
                amount of clear code -- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.

        <div class="about">
            Guido van Rossum is the creator of the Python programming language. He grew up in the Netherlands and
            studied at the
            University of Amsterdam, where he graduated with a Master's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. His
            first job
            after college was as a programmer at CWI, where he worked on the ABC language, the Amoeba distributed
            operating system,
            and a variety of multimedia projects. During this time he created Python as side project. He then moved to
            the United
            States to take a job at a non-profit research lab in Virginia, married a Texan, worked for several other
            startups, and
            moved to California. In 2005 he joined Google, where he obtained the rank of Senior Staff Engineer, and in
            2013 he
            started working for Dropbox as a Principal Engineer. In October 2019 he retired. After a short retirement he
            joined
            Microsoft as Distinguished Engineer in 2020. Until 2018 he was Python's BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life),
            and he is
            still deeply involved in the Python community. Guido and his family live in Silicon Valley, where they love
            hiking,
            biking and birding.
